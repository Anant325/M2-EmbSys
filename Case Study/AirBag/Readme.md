An event data recorder is a device installed in automobiles to record information related to vehicle crashes or accidents. It is also known as a black box. The sensing and diagnostics module, which is controlled by a microprocessor, has multiple functions, as given below:
1. Determines if a severe enough impact has occurred to warrant deployment of the airbag
2. Monitors the airbagâ€™s components
3. Permanently records information

Event data recorders record a wide range of data, including whether brakes were applied, speed and time of impact, steering angle and whether seat belt circuits were shown as buckled or unbuckled at the time of the crash.
