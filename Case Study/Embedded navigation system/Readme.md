The navigation system consists of an embedded circuitry built with a GPS receiver, gyroscope, DVD-ROM and display system. The GPS receiver receives current longitude and latitude values that are compared with the stored map. The gyroscope and other sensors provide road direction and speed. From all the information gathered at the main controller, the display system displays a navigation or route map of the destination on the display screen.
