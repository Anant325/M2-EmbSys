# Block Diagram Explanation-

•	Arduino Uno- Arduino Uno is a Microcontroller which works on ATmega328p.

•	LDR- It is also known as Light Dependent Resistor . An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows     them to be used in light sensing circuits. 

•	Ultrasonic Sensors- An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

•	LED- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.

•	Resistor - A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.


The working principle is very simple. The Arduino Uno continuously checks for the communication from ultrasonic sensor and LDR. The led will be ON when the light intensity and the distance from ultrasonic sensor are satisfied. Otherwise the led will be in OFF position. This is the working principle of Smart Street Lights With LDR and ultrasonic sensor. So that we can minimize the power usage of street lights
